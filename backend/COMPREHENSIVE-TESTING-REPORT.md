## 7. Critical Issues Identified

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. Match Data Seeding Constraint Issue ❌
**Problem:** Database schema has NOT NULL constraints on home_team_id and away_team_id in matches table, preventing external team matches.

**Impact:** Cannot create realistic match fixtures with external opponents.

**Solution:** 
```sql
-- Need to modify matches table schema to allow NULL for external teams
ALTER TABLE matches MODIFY home_team_id INTEGER NULL;
ALTER TABLE matches MODIFY away_team_id INTEGER NULL;
```

#### 2. Authentication System Not Fully Implemented ⚠️
**Problem:** All API endpoints return 401 errors due to missing authentication middleware.

**Impact:** Frontend cannot communicate with backend APIs.

**Recommendation:** 
- Implement JWT authentication middleware
- Create login/logout endpoints
- Add role-based authorization

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 3. Parent-Child Relationships ⚠️
**Problem:** Parent users exist but are not properly linked to player children.

**Impact:** Parents cannot view their children's data.

**Solution:** Update parent_id values in players table.
